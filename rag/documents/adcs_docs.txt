ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control System) is responsible for determining and controlling satellite orientation.

Magnetometers measure Earth's magnetic field and are used for attitude estimation.
Common magnetometer faults include sensor drift, electromagnetic interference, and calibration errors.

Sun sensors (photodiodes) measure sun vector angles.
Common sun sensor issues include sun blinding, sensor saturation, and thermal noise.

Corrective actions for magnetometer anomalies include:
- Recalibration of sensor
- Switching to redundant sensors
- Filtering electromagnetic noise

Corrective actions for sun sensor anomalies include:
- Adjusting operational mode
- Ignoring corrupted readings
- Switching to alternate attitude estimation sources

ADCS-level faults may require switching to safe mode or relying on gyroscopes temporarily.
